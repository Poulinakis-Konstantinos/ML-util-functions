# ML-util-functions
Python scripts I often find myself using while creating machine learning pipelines.
- Folder restructuring, train-val splitting. 
- Checking for corrupted images and naming conventions, image-label separation and more.
- Premature Ending error in Images (missing the EOI D9 code)

Check the folder scripts for all the available python scripts. 
I update the repo often and add new utility scripts.

Feel free to use them for your own purposes but make sure you understand what each script does before using it :) .
